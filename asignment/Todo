      Drawing a moving horizontal bar chart. (using divs)
      Start with a fixed array of numbers.
      Every one second, remove the first number & add a new random number at the end.
      Below are sample snapshots of how it will look at 0,1,2 and 3rd second.


                              02

      Solve the Excercise 01 with the elements having shades of blue.
      Every new random number will also come in with a random shade of blue (the colour stays with it till it moves out).
