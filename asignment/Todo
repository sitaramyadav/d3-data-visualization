  Drawing a moving horizontal bar chart. (using divs)
  Start with a fixed array of numbers.
  Every one second, remove the first number & add a new random number at the end.
  Below are sample snapshots of how it will look at 0,1,2 and 3rd second.


                  02

  Solve the Excercise 01 with the elements having shades of blue.
  Every new random number will also come in with a random shade of blue (the colour stays with it till it moves out).

  Below are sample snapshots

  Below are the student records to be used for this exercise:
  [
  {name:'ramesh',subject:'maths',score:87},
  {name:'suresh',subject:'maths',score:45},
  {name:'pokemon',subject:'english',score:65},
  {name:'mary',subject:'kannada',score:44},
  {name:'riya',subject:'science',score:72},
  {name:'katie',subject:'social studies',score:82},
  {name:'katie',subject:'maths',score:98},

  {name:'riya',subject:'tamil',score:75},
  {name:'pokemon',subject:'sports',score:95},
  {name:'pokemon',subject:'social studies',score:32}
  ]

  The initial screen should display:


                                04


                          For n = 1 to 10 Generate a visual table.

  The Heading Row will be Title, and numbers 1 to 10
  The Second row will be "n" and values of n
  The Third row will be "n square" and values of n square
  The Fourth row will be "log(n)" and values of log(n)
  The Fifth row will be "log(n) rounded" and values of log(n) rounded to the closest whole number"

  PS: Read the requirement and prepare a rough chart yourself, before using someone's help to get clarity.
  Have an idea (right or wrong) before seeking someone else's view.
  It hard to get better at anything if you skip the hard parts.

                              05

  Show numbers 0 to 10 in a box. The font size of number 0 is 12px:30px and that of 10 is 120px:180px.
  The below picture shows how it would look:
